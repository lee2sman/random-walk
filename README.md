# Random Walk

Random Walk is an online magazine of computational art by Purchase College New Media, organized by Professor Lee Tusman. Each issue features new works by the Purchase community, responding to the particular constraints of presenting work within a web browser. The inaugural issue features work from students of Programming For Visual Artists, who created computational text and artwork using the p5.js library in Fall 2024.
