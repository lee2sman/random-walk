Random Walk is an online magazine of computational art, organized by [Lee Tusman](https://faculty.purchase.edu/lee.tusman/) in the department of [New Media](https://www.purchase.edu/academics/new-media/) at Purchase College. Each issue features new computational media, responding to the particular constraints of presenting work within a web browser. The inaugural issue features work from students of Programming For Visual Artists, who created computational text and artwork using the p5.js library in Fall 2024.

Run `./duotone path/to/inputfile path/to/outputfile` to convert an image or `./duotone --help` for usage info.
