	    <h2>About Issue 1</h2>
	    <p>In this first edition of Random Walk we present the artwork of students from Programming for Visual Artists at Purchase College. This course, in the department of New Media, is for students without previous programming experience. While the class is meant to teach the technical skills of programming, our campus community is intimately affected by both local and national culture and community. In the wake of public political conflict and the many challenges students face head-on today, many students created computational artworks responding to issues of mental health. Students also created abstract narratives, interactive software, and procedural animations. All of the works were produced with the p5.js javascript library, a tool to produce interactive artwork, built by an inclusive community of artists and educators. Each project is represented by a duotoned screenshot, description and link to the work running fullscreen in the browser via the Web Editor. For each of the projects you can click on the code icon in the top right to view its full program code.</p>
	    <h2>About Random Walk</h2>

	    <p>
	    Random Walk is an online magazine of computational art, organized by <a href="https://faculty.purchase.edu/lee.tusman/">Lee Tusman</a> in the department of <a href="https://www.purchase.edu/academics/new-media/">New Media</a> at Purchase College. Each issue features new computational media, responding to the particular constraints of presenting work within a web browser. The inaugural issue features work from students of Programming For Visual Artists, who created computational text and artwork using the <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js library</a> in Fall 2024.
