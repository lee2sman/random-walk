	      <em>Helena</em>
	      <p>This piece of art was made as a reminder to breathe and focus on the good in the world. There are two sets of data when it comes to this project. There is a positive list and a negative list. There is also a circle in the middle that is there to "breathe with you." This program is meant to show that despite dark times up ahead, and things may feel hard, looking for small moments of happiness is important. As one watches the program, they can see that the colorful positives start to grow and it’s almost hard to focus on those ominous words and thoughts.</p>

	      <em>Casey</em>
	      <p>I wanted to expand on the first draft, so I added more words and randomization. To make it feel more chaotic, I also made everything move faster. I wanted to make everything randomize out of sync to increase the effect but I couldn't figure out how so I decided to just increase the speed. Finally, I changed the background color to a dark red because I feel like it fits my theme of stress and chaos better.</p>

	      <em>Kelvin</em>
	      <p>My computational program is a recreation of the minigame within the indie horror game Five Nights at Freddy's 2 by developer Scott Cawthon. The short minigame, titled Give Gifts, Give Life centers around the player character (The Puppet) moving across the screen by the player, being tasked to move to and deliver masks to the other characters on screen to progress through the minigame. My recreation is designed for players to freely move the character with the W,A,S and D keys, also being able to interact with the program while referencing the source material as much as possible. The program uses a combination of functions presented amongst the whole semester, from images, sounds, distance and more, all while basing it off of one of my favorite video games. </p>

	      <em>Wyatt</em>
	      <p>This piece is meant to be similar to the board game “the game of LIFE” in the fact that i wanted to show that even though there are different generations, peoples lives can be so similar in how they end. I wanted to give this vibe that each new generation that pops up doesn’t have to be the same generation from the one pervious. It’s meant just to show that most peoples lives end up the same even with slight differences with something like their hobbies, marriage, etc. We are all just living life in our own ways but we are all still connected one way or another.</p>

		<em>Cameron</em>
		<p>My computational artwork consists of words from a single sentence to allow the user to make up their own story within that one sentence. When the user presses space bar, one or two extra words appear after the "it was ..." prompt at random. The user can either tell a very short story about clocks, bears, or doorsteps. </p>

	      <em>Jack</em>
	      <p>In my program you're a drawing but instead of it being with a pencil it is with letters on the screen. At first it may seem like it's just random letters but if you really take the time out of your day to patiently draw them outside to side across the screen there might be a message. I wanted this to be as if someone was there to listen, but they weren't really listening to what someone has to say. To understand someone's problems you're going to have to take the time out of your day to listen and understand what they have to say. </p>

	      <p>A fight with the mind about positive vs negative thoughts about oneself. Hiding under an umbrella for protection. Self-love and self-hate. Trying to find a middle ground. If I love myself, am I a narcissist? If I hate myself, am I depressed?</p>

		<h3><a href="yahir">Your Spotlight</a></h3>
	      <em>Yahir</em>
	      <p>This code brings together poetic storytelling and dynamic visuals in an interactive way. It shows the first few lines of a poem, one after another, in a moving spotlight that then replays the lines in random positions, gradually filling the screen. It then changes onto a black screen with a spotlight in the middle, which displays the message "keep going." The poem reflected chasing dreams: it's acknowledging the challenges, sacrifices, and losses one may face, including losing people and stability  in times. The closing message serves to remind to keep going. This project is inspired by my personal story in pursuing soccer dreams, hoping that this will help someone get up and move forward.</p>
